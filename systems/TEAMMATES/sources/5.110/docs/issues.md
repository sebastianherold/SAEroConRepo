## Issue labels

### Status (`s.*`)

This label classifies the issue based on its **status**.

* No `s.*` label and no other labels: issue is yet to be triaged
* `s.NeedsInfo`: more information is needed from the issue reporter
* `s.ToInvestigate`: the issue needs to be validated by a core team member
* `s.OnHold`: the issue's validity has been put on hold pending some other event
* No `s.*` label and other labels present: issue is accepted

### Category (`c.*`)

This label classifies the issue based on its **type**.

* `c.Bug`: a bug report
* `c.Epic`: a feature that is worth many user stories
* `c.DevOps`: workflow-related or build-related improvements and additions
* `c.Release`: release-related issues; this is reserved for core team members working on managing release
* `c.Message`: a means of communication with the dev team, e.g. help requests; while this is not an issue to be worked on, any contributor is welcome to chip in their opinions

### Priority (`p.*`)

This label classifies the issue based on its **importance**, as determined by the project maintainers.

* `p.Critical`: would like to fix it ASAP and release as a hot patch
* `p.Urgent`: would like to handle in the very next release
* `p.High`: enhances user experience, software design, or development process significantly, would like to do in the next few releases

* `p.Low`: very little impact, unlikely to do in the near future
* `p.Zero`: unlikely to do, ever

### Difficulty Level (`d.*`)

This label classifies the issue based on its **difficulty level**.

* `d.FirstTimers`: easy; to do as the first issue for new developers (one developer should not do more than one of these)
* `d.Contributors`: moderate difficulty, small localized change; suitable for contributors (new developers who are not first timers)
* `d.Committers`: more difficult issues that are better left for committers or more senior developers
