          Ooops! Your Google account is not known to TEAMMATES

        To access a course on TEAMMATES, you need to wait until an instructor adds you to that course. As a confirmation, TEAMMATES will send you instructions on how to access that particular course.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you 'joined' the course in TEAMMATES using a Google account before, but cannot login anymore, these are the possible reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
            You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past. In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again. Logout and re-login using the other Google account. If you don't remember which Google account you used previously, email us from the same email account to which you receive TEAMMATES emails.
          </li>
          <li>
            You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently. In that case,
            <a href="/contact.jsp">
              email us
            </a>
            so that we can reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.
          </li>
          <li>
            You joined this course just a few seconds ago and your data may be still in the process of propagating through our servers. In that case, please click on the
