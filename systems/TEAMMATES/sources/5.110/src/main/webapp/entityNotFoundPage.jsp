        TEAMMATES could not locate what you were trying to access. <br><br>
        <br><br>
        Possible reasons include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You clicked on a link received in email, but the link was mangled by the email software. Try copy-pasting the entire link into the Browser address bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          The entity (e.g. course, session) you were trying to access was deleted by an instructor after the link was sent to you by TEAMMATES.
          <br><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      If the problem persists, please inform <a class="link" href="contact.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TEAMMATES support team</a>.
