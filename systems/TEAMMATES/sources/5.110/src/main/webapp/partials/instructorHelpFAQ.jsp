                <div class="helpSectionContent">
                    This is because the system ‘normalizes’ those values so that there is no artificial inflation of contribution. For example, if a student says everyone contributed ‘Equal share + 10%’, the system automatically normalize it to ‘Equal share’ because in reality that is what the student means.
                    <br>‘Normalize’ here means scale up/down the values so that the (sum of contributions) = (
                    <span class="italic">n</span> x Equal Share) where
                    <span class="italic">n</span> is the number of students being reviewed.

                <div class="helpSectionContent">
                    No. The perceived contribution is calculated based on what his team members perceive as his contribution. His own opinion about his own contribution is not considered for the calculation.
                    <br>
                    <br>Students enter contribution estimates for self and team members, using the scale Equal share + x%. e.g. Equal share -10%
                    <br>
                    <br>Based on those values, we try to deduce the student's answer to the following two questions:
                    <div class="helpSectionContent">
                        (a) In your opinion, what portion of the project did you do?
                        <br> (b) In your opinion, if your teammates are doing the project by themselves without you, how do they compare against each other in terms of contribution?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </div>
                    In the calculation, we do not allow (a) to affect (b). We use (b) to calculate the average perceived contribution for each student. A more detailed version of this calculation can be found

                <div class="helpSectionContent">
                    No. But courses bigger than 100 students need to divide the course into sections so that TEAMMATES know how to paginate reports when the entire report is too big to show in one go.
